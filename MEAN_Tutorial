What is MEAN, and why it's GOOD?
So, what is a MEAN stack? The idea is quite simple actually - you have 4 main parts:

MongoDB as the database
Express as the web framework
AngularJS as the frontend framework, and
Node.js as the server platform
These are some of the advantages of a MEAN stack:

Single language is used in the whole application
Support for the MVC pattern
JSON is used for transfering data
Node.js's huge module library
Open source so you can tweak it to your preferences if you're an experienced user
Ok, enough with the chit-chat, now we'll go and install all the necessary parts.3
